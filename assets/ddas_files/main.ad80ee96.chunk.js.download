In addition to balance, we\u2019re fixing two bugs, and disabling two bugged Augments that could jeopardize the quality of games.\\n\\n---\\n### BUG FIX\\n__Developer\'s Notes:__ Our initial 14.3 B patch earlier today introduced a bug that would allow Superfan Headliner items to sometimes carry on even when the trait wasn\u2019t active.\\n\\n- Superfan items now consistently disappear upon deactivation\\n\\n---\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer\'s Notes:__ Heartsteel has been the big winner of 14.3\u2019s competitive scene, so we\u2019re shipping a nerf to Heartsteel 5 which when combined with Raise the Stakes has led to some incredibly powerful late game boards. \\n- Heartsteel Heart Multiplier: 1/2.25/5.5/18x \u21d2 1/2/5.5/18x\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS\\n__Developer\'s Notes:__ These changes are incredibly light, but we see an opportunity to ever-so-slightly refine the meta ahead of the set\u2019s biggest competition. \\n- Kayle Ability on-hit damage: 35/55/80% AP \u21d2 35/52/75% AP\\n- Riven Ability damage: 90% AD \u21d2 85% AD\\n- Zed AD: 75 \u21d2 72\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n__Developer\'s Notes:__ Extended Play is in a tricky spot, overperforming despite having a bug that makes it weaker than intended. Instead of fixing the bug and unintentionally buffing an already strong Augment, we\u2019re choosing to disable it for the sake of consistency & ensuring that we\'re only seeing expected behavior across all of our Augments.\\n\\nHeartthrobs is also currently bugged to only boost Hearts from unit kills, which makes it do very little because of the way our rounding works. Since fixing it is a MASSIVE buff, and since our competitive players are Heartsteel extraordinaires (see Heartsteel Cup from last weekend), we\u2019re opting to disable it instead of over-buffing it, or allowing it to continue as a sub-optimal Augment option. \\n- Extended Play has been disabled.\\n- Heartthrobs has been disabled.\\n\\n---\\n### BUG FIXES\\n- Scrappy Inventions now gives components at the start of the next two stages as intended\\n- Guinsoo\u2019s Rageblade stacks will no longer sometimes reset when a unit is summoned in combat."}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z1yb6g2ffrt0"}},"id":"OMz2USfBvHiu96NOfxXto","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2024-02-07T09:35:55.281Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-07T09:37:24.622Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"patchTftactics"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Patch 14.3","description":"## SYSTEMS\\n---\\n\\n### LOOT DISTRIBUTION\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re lowering item drop variance by ensuring players receive the same number of items at each stage.

Our main goals here are to do a series of smaller changes to the biggest outliers. The 3.5 Revival is still a fun mode that should be focused on nostalgia and good times over perfect balance, so while this list of changes may look long, we\'re not trying to ship a patch that forces you to learn a new meta (or even a new comp).

Starting patch 14.2, we will run a diagnostics check to see if your computer is ready for this update. If not, please review our troubleshooting guide or reach out to Player Support.\\n\\nIf you originally failed the check, it will re-run at a later point or you can manually re-run it by clicking on the settings icon on the top right and \u201cCheck for Compatibility\u201d under General > Vanguard System Check.\\n\\nThis will not mean that Vanguard is active or being used for League & TFT yet, this is just to give players ample heads up and opportunity to be ready before it\u2019s a requirement. For more information please check out our support article on Vanguard.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## WINDOWS MIN SPEC UPDATE\\n---\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Beginning Wednesday February 21st (patch 14.4), we are updating our minimum system requirements and will no longer be supporting Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 for all League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics games. To maintain the stability and performance of our game we sometimes need to deprecate support for legacy Operating Systems that aren\u2019t widely used by our players. If you\u2019re still playing on these versions of Windows, please consider updating to continue playing. Please see our min spec support page for more details. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## LUNAR FESTIVAL\\n---\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ The Lunar Festival brings an in-client hub, where you can access the Set 3.5 Revival: Galaxies game mode, view your event pass progress, keep track of your missions, and more! To further the festivities we\u2019ve also brought a number of cosmetics that are sure to leave your loadout looking stellar! Chibi Sona, Chibi Porcelain Lux, the Golden Dragon Skyscraper, and more all arrive shortly after patch 14.02 goes live! \\n\\n---\\n\\n## TFT\u2019S FIRST MID-SET REVIVAL\\n---\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ TFT\u2019s first set revival is almost here, and we\u2019re gearing up for galactic exploration with the revival of the Galaxies mid-set, Return to the Stars, as a temporary game mode available from patch 14.02 (Jan 24th) until the end of patch 14.03 during our Lunar Festival event!\\n\\nOne thing that has changed since the release of the above article is our bag sizes. After PBE testing, we saw and heard feedback around the revived set having too much reliance on 3 starring a 4-cost to win a lobby. This is tied to the expanded bag sizes (50 per unit), so we\u2019ve opted to reduce the count for 4 and 5-cost units to 20 (still much more than live). 1,2, and 3-cost units will continue to have 50 copies in the shared pool. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## MISCELLANEOUS\\n---\\n\\n### LOADOUT RANDOMIZER\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re adding a much desired button to the lobby screen that will allow you to randomize your loadout (Tactician+Arena+Boom) to keep your style as varied as your games (Portals + Augments + Items + Team Comps). We hope this gives collectors the variety they\u2019ve requested! \\n\\n- Randomizer takes the form of a dice logo in the lobby screen both on PC and Mobile\\n- It\'ll randomize amongst your entitled content\\n- There\'s a small delay so that players don\'t spam it\\n- It does NOT randomize emotes or other content\\n\\n---\\n### BASE BOOMS FROM PRESTIGE TIER TREASURE REALMS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ With the removal of Chibi Headliner K/DA POP/STARS Kai\u2019Sa from Treasure Realms, we\u2019re retroactively granting all base Booms for players who unlocked base Chibis through this Collector\u2019s Bounty. It\u2019s worth noting that base Booms for base Chibis will also come at the end of Prestige Dragon Fist Lee Sin\u2019s Treasure Realm stay. In situations where you unlocked the base Chibi from the Prestige tier Treasure Realms and then purchased the corresponding Boom, we\u2019ll be refunding the RP spent on said Boom. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## SYSTEMS\\n---\\n\\n### PORTALS\\n- Cruel Pact can no longer be offered in the Radiant Blessing portal.\\n- Silver Symphony & Decrescendo have been removed.\\n\\n---\\n### STREAK NOTIFICATIONS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Syncing up the scoreboard notifications with our changes in streak gold that we implemented in the last patch. \\n- Winstreak scoreboard notifications now display at 5 wins and at 8 wins, and show the correct streak length.\\n\\n---\\n### RECOMMENDED ITEM CATEGORIES\\n- AD Carry: Edge of Night \u21d2 Red Buff\\n- AD Caster: Edge of Night \u21d2 Red Buff\\n- AD Caster: Bloodthirster \u21d2 Hand of Justice\\n\\n---\\n### HEADLINER RULES\\n__Developer Notes:__ Previously if you passed on something like Brawler Olaf, any champ that COULD have Headliner Brawler would be temporarily blocked for 4 offerings. \\n- Updated a rule that blocked units that shared a trait with a previously offered Headliner. This rule should now only block the trait skipped from being the Headliner and still allow the unit to appear as their other trait(s).\\n\\n## LARGE CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ In a twist of fate, Disco has gone from feeling funky to a full blown Night Fever in just one patch. Part of this is due to the power of the disco ball, as its buff gets the party rolling too fast. We\u2019re going lighter here as we\u2019ve also got a nerf for the trait\u2019s 4-cost carry later on.\\n\\nPunk just isn\u2019t tough enough in the late game, which is why we\u2019re beefing up their base stat gains which are in turn amplified by the percentage gains from rolling. What can I say? This trait just likes to get amped up. \\n- Disco Attack Speed Per Tick: 5/10/15/20% \u21d2 5/8/12/20%\\n- Disco Healing Per Tick: 2/3/3/5% \u21d2 2/3/3/4%\\n- Punk AD: 17/28/42% \u21d2 18/30/45%\\n- Punk HP: 170/280/420 \u21d2 180/300/450\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 1\\n__Developer Notes:__ Better base AD means better scaling upon starring up, itemizing, and Punk amplifications, which should allow this loose cannon to cut loose from the C-tier. \\n- Jinx AD: 45 \u21d2 50\\n- Kennen HP: 650 \u21d2 700\\n- K\u2019Sante Spell Base Damage Reduction: 25% \u21d2 20%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 2\\n__Developer Notes:__ Kayle has been a confusing champion. Before this rework she had to first cast her ability to ascend and then deal her on-hit magic damage that shreds MR for 4 seconds AND THEN she would deal her finale damage to enemies around the target. This not only made her awkward to start up, but also confusing to play. We hope with this simplified rework she\u2019ll be more intuitive and, with that, more playable. A mix of AS and AP items are still going to be useful on her, but with her higher mana cost breakpoint, experimenting with more AS or even Spear of Shojin could be useful when fielding an AP comp for a more frequent cast of her active which shreds MR. \\n- Katarina Spell Damage: 140/210/315% AP \u21d2 150/225/340% AP\\n- Kayle (REWORK): Now passively deals magic damage on each hit. Active now immediately deals the AoE (finale) damage and applies Shred.\\n- Kayle Mana nerf: 0/30 \u21d2 0/120\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 3\\n__Developer Notes:__ While Urgot has seen success in various comps, those comps are often carried by his banjo toting pals (Read: Samira, Vex, and our favorite horsie) in the late game where Urgot falls off harder than just about every other 3-cost. Giving his ability an additional bonus damage component will help him get unstuck on unstoppable solo-frontliners in the hopes that this crab-legged dreadnought can be as dreaded as our crab-legged raver. \\n- Lulu Spell Third Cast Damage: 120/180/280% AP \u21d2 150/225/360% AP\\n- Riven Ability Damage: 100% AD \u21d2 90% AD\\n- Urgot (REWORK): Now deals 50% bonus damage if his spell only hits 1 target.\\n- Urgot Spell Damage: 175/175/180% AD + 15/25/40% AP \u21d2 160/160/165% AD + 15/25/40% AP\\n- Vex Stun duration: 1.5s \u21d2 0.75s\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 4\\n__Developer Notes:__ Karthus has had the issue of having a dominant and impactful first cast (if it crit), but then becoming the center of attention as his mana bar takes longer to fill the closer you stare at it (this is real, I swear). With this rework we\u2019re not only opening up new avenues for Karthus to scale and reducing his reliance on a random critical strike, but also ensuring that repeat casts ramp up his damage even more\u2014and with a smaller max Mana pool, he\u2019ll certainly be casting more! \\n- Karthus (REWORKED): Karthus\u2019s ability will now always critically strike if able to.\\n- Karthus gains bonus Ability Power based on his Critical Strike Chance\\n- Karthus no longer gains mana from kills, now gains 30% Ability Power after each cast.\\n- Karthus Mana: 30/120 \u21d2 15/105\\n- Karthus Ability Damage: 270/405/900 \u21d2 175/260/580\\n- Twisted Fate Mana: 30/105 \u21d2 30/120\\n- Twisted Fate Card Damage: 50/75/225 \u21d2 45/70/225\\n\\n---\\n### HEADLINERS\\n- Kai\u2019Sa: +15% AD \u21d2 +25% AD (Still has +2 range and dashes farther)\\n- Yone: +200 HP & +20% AD \u21d2 +150 HP & +15% AD\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Name a better friendship than Twin Terror and Executioner\u2026 Oh, you, and I? I guess you\u2019re right. Regardless, we\u2019re taking out the critical strike chance bonus for Twin Terror to make the Augment more generally strong and less dependent on critical strike scaling synergies. \\n- Bigger Shot (Big Shot) Damage: 75% AD \u21d2 85% AD\\n- Heartthrobs (REWORKED): You now gain 20% more Heartsteel Hearts instead of keeping 20% each time you get rewards.\\n- Last Stand Bonus Stats: +180 HP, 18 Armor/MR, and 18% Omnivamp \u21d2 +160 HP, 16 Armor/MR, and 16% Omnivamp\\n- Submit to the Pit (Mosher) Stats: +3 Armor/MR/AP/AD/AS \u21d2 +4 Armor/MR/AP/AD/AS\\n- Too Big to Fail (Bruiser) Damage: 40% HP \u21d2 35% HP\\n- Twin Terror I Critical Strike Chance: 25% \u21d2 0%\\n- Twin Terror I Health: 250 \u21d2 350\\n- Twin Terror I Attack Speed: 25% \u21d2 35%\\n- Twin Terror II Critical Strike Chance: 35% \u21d2 0%\\n- Twin Terror II Health: 350 \u21d2 500\\n- Twin Terror II Attack Speed: 35% \u21d2 50%\\n\\n---\\n### ITEMS AND ARTIFACTS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Goldmancer\u2019s Staff provided too much consistent econ (especially early game) when used on a comp with a singular carry that racks up most of the kills regardless. \\n- Thief\u2019s Gloves are less likely to roll ideal items at level 7,8, and 9\\n- Goldmancer\u2019s Staff (Artifact) Gold per kill: 2 \u21d2 1\\n\\n## SMALL CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### TRAITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Moshers now mosh a bit harder when capped out. \\n- Mosher Attack Speed: 20/40/60% \u21d2 20/40/70%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS\\n__Developer Notes:__ A few Big Shots are firing even bigger shots. \\n- Corki Spell Damage: 300% AD \u21d2 320% AD\\n- Lillia Mana: 70/130 \u21d2 70/120\\n- Olaf is now categorized as an AD Fighter\\n- Yasuo Spell Damage: 300% AD \u21d2 280% AD\\n- Jax Attack Speed: 0.85 \u21d2 0.9\\n- Miss Fortune Spell Damage: 280/280/290% AD \u21d2 295/295/305% AD\\n- Ezreal Spell Damage (single target): 350/350/700% AD \u21d2 370/370/740% AD\\n- Poppy Spell healing on hit: 5/5/5% HP \u21d2 5/5/10% HP\\n- Sona (Heal Form): Sona will no longer send her healing auto attacks at non-champions (dummies and Illaoi tentacles) unless they\u2019re the last units alive\\n- Sona (Attack Speed & Ability Power): Sona can no longer target training dummies and Illaoi tentacles\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n__Developer Notes:__ More gold = more good. \\n- Good for Something Gold drop chance: 30% \u21d2 35%\\n- Lategame Specialist Gold: 30 \u21d2 33\\n\\n## BUG FIXES\\n---\\n\\n### GAMEPLAY\\n- Too emotional: Emotional connection no longer reduces your units max mana to 10 the first time you take the Augment.\\n- Multi-Talented Akali no longer keeps an additional trait when swapped in shop.

We\u2019re still in early days here, so be sure to report any bugs you may observe. \\n- Spectate will go to our live client on patch 14.1, January 9th\\n- Spectate will have a delay of 1 minute\\n- Right click a pal from the friends list to spectate them and be prepared to congratulate them on their top four, or console them after their loss\\n- Spectate will come to Riot Regions only this patch\\n\\n## SYSTEMS\\n---\\n\\n### NEW PORTALS\\n__Developer Notes:__ Some wild, some mild, some favorites returning, and one that heralds the rise of the Scuttle Crab\u2014you\u2019ve been warned!\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also updated the odds of seeing our rare Portals (such as Scuttle Puddle) to be even across all Portals!\\n- Spatula: Start with a Spatula.\\n- Tactician\u2019s Crown: Start with a Tactician\u2019s Crown (gain +1 team size).\\n- Support Anvil: Start with 1 Support item anvil.\\n- Crescendo: Augments this game will be silver, gold, then prismatic tier.\\n- Decrescendo: Augments this game will be prismatic, gold, then silver tier.\\n- Champion Delivery: Twice per stage, gain a high cost champion. The cost increases with game time.\\n- Radiant Blessing: At 40 player health, receive a blessing that contains powerful loot. This occurs at 10 player health in Hyper Roll\\n- Treasure Armory: On stage 4-7, choose a 5-piece package of powerful loot. This occurs on Stage 8-1 in Hyper Roll.\\n- Wandering Trainers: Start with a Training Dummy with 3 permanently attached trait emblems.\\n- Loot Subscription: Every stage, gain random loot from a highly varied pool.\\n- Crab Rave: Dancing Crabs replace PvE encounters and drop bonus loot, but crabs on Stage 5+ are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Grants loot every other stage in Hyper Roll.\\n- All Portals in the game have an equal chance of appearing\\n\\n---\\n### STREAK GOLD\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019ve seen the Open Fort strategy (completely selling board to accumulate more gold) be much more valued than going WLWLW (win/loss/win/loss/win) and preserving Tactician Health. A WLWLW player gets 0 streak gold, while a LLLLL player gets 10 gold, which can be a lot considering the importance of early econ. We\u2019re reducing the value of that early econ by restricting access to streak gold until later in Stage 2, as now LLLLL players will only get 6 gold (and still lose a lot of Health). Is the 6 gold completely worth playing Open Fort\u2014maybe in some situations, but we don\u2019t expect this to be a strategy you want to go for before seeing the outcome of 2-2, or even 2-3. \\n- You have to hit higher streaks to make gold now\\n- 1g: 2 - 3 \u21d2 3 - 4 wins/losses\\n- 2g: 4 \u21d2 5 wins/losses\\n- 3g: 5 \u21d2 6 wins/losses\\n\\n---\\n### EMBLEM ADJUSTMENT\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re making Country 7 easier to access, allowing you to live your cowboy dreams\u2026 or cowboy night-mares\u2026 We\u2019ll be adjusting the power of the trait to accommodate the newfound access to its highest tier (see Traits in the SMALL section).\\n\\nJazz is at its best when it\u2019s improvised\u2014there\u2019s no room for cookie-cutter recipes here. With the Jazz Emblem no longer craftable, we will be increasing the power of the trait (see Traits section). \\n- Country is now craftable and comes from Spatula + Negatron Cloak\\n- Jazz is now uncraftable\\n\\n---\\n### HEADLINER RULES\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re adjusting the rules for Headliners to show up in your shop in order to prevent awkward moments where you can\u2019t three-star your reroll carry, while also making 3-star 4 and 5-cost champions harder to hit through the mechanic. The old rule was also confusing as it led to weird situations where champions in opponent shops could contribute to not seeing a Headliner you may have wanted. \\n- 1/2/3-cost Headliners have no restrictions based upon copies you own\\n- 4-cost Headliners can\u2019t show up if you own more than 4 copies of that champion\\n- 5-cost Headliners can\u2019t show up if you own more than 3 copies of that champion\\n\\n## LARGE CHANGES\\n---\\n\\n### TRAITS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ If you compare the output of a trait like Big Shot (40/72/120) versus 8-Bit which requires time to stack (45/75/120) it\u2019s a long shot from a bit underpowered. Even with this reality, the trait isn\u2019t too weak thanks to its powerful champions like Caitlyn and Corki. We\u2019re going to put more power in the trait, while pulling some from its carries to keep 8-Bit from becoming 8/8 bit.\\n\\nRight now 5 EDM is too strong, and Jax is the strongest version of it. Lowering the power of 5 EDM specifically also allows us to raise the trait power at 3/4, as well as some of the other EDM champions as needed.\\n\\nHigher levels of Emo were certainly sad, but not in the way you\u2019d want it to be. Now as you go up in Emo breakpoints, you can expect to cast more and more often. This should help vertical Emo Poppy and Vex mostly, as we\u2019ll be giving Annie other adjustments to balance things out.\\n\\nThe way Executioner\u2019s crit rate scaled with enemy health wasn\u2019t very satisfying especially at 4 and 6. Now, they will critically strike low health enemies a lot more and much harder, leading to the vertical living their best crit life.\\n\\nHeartsteel is getting a rework, but before we get into that it\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ll also be nerfing the base trait a bit since it\u2019s been too consistent. We\u2019re adding a new \u201cRaise the Stakes\u201d option instead of automatically cashing out after four player combats. This will let players chase after massive cash outs\u2014it\u2019s risky though, as you will have to delay your rewards to a later time AND are punished for winning during this time.\\n\\nSentinel 6 and 8 are able to stall out a bit more than intended. We\u2019re giving the trait a minor nerf at 6, but 8 is going down more due to the availability of Emblems from new Portals.\\n\\nSpellweaver 10 has been virtually impossible to hit, so we\u2019re just removing it as a Prismatic option, and then buffing accordingly. With the support of some of our new Portals especially, 9 should be achievable. \\n- 8-Bit AD per Stack: 4.5/7.5/12% \u21d2 5/9/14%\\n- Crowd Diver Bonus Damage: 5/30/60% \u21d2 12/30/50%\\n- Dazzler enemy damage reduction: 15% \u21d2 10%\\n- EDM Jax Spell Frequency: 7 \u21d2 8 sec\\n- EDM Spell Effectiveness: 80/100/110/125% \u21d2 90/100/110/130%\\n- EDM Frequency Reduction: 0/0/1/2 \u21d2 0/0/1/1 sec\\n- Emo Mana Reduction: 20/25/30% \u21d2 20/30/40%\\n- Emo Mana on Ally Death: 10/20/25 \u21d2 20/30/40\\n- Emo 6 Piece Bonus AP: 20 \u21d2 10\\n- Executioner base Critical Strike Damage: 5/25/45% \u21d2 5/15/30%\\n- Executioner max Critical Strike Chance: 15/35/55% \u21d2 25/100/200%\\n- Guardian max HP Shield Amount: 25/40/60% \u21d2 25/45/70%\\n- Heartsteel NEW: Raise the Stakes! - Now after every 4 turns, you can cash out like normal OR you can choose to raise the stakes. If you do, your box turns golden and you are in high risk mode. You gain double the hearts, but if you win a combat, you lose 50% of your current total. If you manage to lose 8 times in a row, gain an additional 80 bonus hearts.\\n- Heartsteel base Heart Rate: 100/250/600/1000% \u21d2 100/225/550/1000%\\n- Hyperpop Mana Per Cast: 3/5/7/10 \u21d2 5/10/15/20\\n- Jazz max HP Per Trait: 1.5/2/3% \u21d2 1.5/2.5/4%\\n- Sentinel Base Armor & MR: 16/35/60/125 \u21d2 16/35/55/100\\n- Spellweaver changed the 10 piece (Prismatic) to a 9 piece (Gold)\\n- Spellweaver base AP: 20/35/60/200 \u21d2 20/35/70/120\\n- Spellweaver AP per cast: 1/2/3/10 \u21d2 1/2/3/4\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 1\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Annie does well with exact items that make her cast a bunch, but when she doesn\u2019t get exactly what she wants, she throws a fit taking the form of bottom four\u2014she is just a child you know. Her reliance on perfect items is due to how much power is in Disentegrate\u2019s powered up state. We\u2019re raising her pre-powered up form, and lowering that rapid fire state to help her control her temper, and maybe be happy with other items as well.\\n\\nNami will now cast more frequently, dealing more damage through a fight, but with a reduced stun duration, although that too should even out with how many bubbles she\u2019s throwing.\\n\\nFor the remainder of the buffs here, we\u2019re lifting the weakest 1-costs so that even they can one day dream of being a reroll carry. Special shout out for the Taric buff that should make this warm bodied tank a truly outrageous 3-star Disconaut. \\n- Annie Disintegrate Damage: 195/295/440 \u21d2 220/330/495\\n- Annie Disintegrate powered up Attack Speed: 50% \u21d2 40%\\n- Annie Disintegrate powered up Second Disintegrate Damage: 115/170/255 \u21d2 80/120/180\\n- Nami Mana buff: 15/75 \u21d2 15/60\\n- Nami Disco Prison Stun duration: 1.5 \u21d2 1.25 sec\\n- Nami Disco Prison now has a slightly lower mana lockout period to prevent cases of not getting mana for attacks at higher attack speeds (Rageblade at the Disco Nami is now online)\\n- Olaf AD: 50 \u21d2 55\\n- Olaf Berserker Rage Attack Speed based on missing 1% HP ratio: 0.12% \u21d2 0.15%\\n- Tahm Kench AD: 60 \u21d2 70\\n- Tahm Kench Armor & MR: 35 \u21d2 40\\n- Taric Mirroball\u2019s Blessing Damage: 100/150/225 \u21d2 250/375/565\\n- Vi The Harder They Fall AD%: 220% \u21d2 330%\\n- Vi The Harder They Fall empowered AD%: 320% \u21d2 450%\\n- Vi recommended Items changed to Attack Fighter\\n- Yasuo Synthesizer Strike AD per kill: 1% \u21d2 1.5%\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 2\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Bard\u2019s damaging notes (Doots) have more impact than his healing notes (Chimes), so we\u2019re making sure he more reliably Doots on his foes than Chimes on his pals to raise his base power. That alongside a damage buff to his Doots will have Bard shooting and dooting his way to a Desperado collab.\\n\\nWhile Garen Headliner has found success, his base form could use a Power-Up! We\u2019re taking some of his Headliner power and putting it in the base to keep him more consistent.\\n\\nKai\u2019Sa is very good at surviving and using Big Shot procs to finish out fights, but she could use better ratios to become a more reliable carry. We\u2019re buffing her AD and AP scaling, so she can benefit more from the regular AD slams and AP from K/DA, Blue Buff, or Shojin.\\n\\nWith a nerf to Crowd Diver 6, reroll Katarina\u2019s capped out board power has been lowered, and we\u2019re compensating by giving some power back to her as AS. \\n- Bard Improv Doot Damage: 190/285/430 \u21d2 200/300/450\\n- Bard Improv will always cast 3 damage notes (Doots) and 1 healing note (Chime) while there is a valid heal target\\n- Garen HP: 750 \u21d2 800\\n- Garen Power-Up!

His utility, tankiness, and traits make him a high-value frontliner in many comps, so we\u2019re lowering his utility in a stun duration nerf that\u2019ll hopefully make him easier to find, for all our sakes. \\n- Ekko Record Scratch Stun Duration: 1.5 \u21d2 1 sec\\n- Lux Laser Light Show Damage: 230/345/550 \u21d2 250/375/550\\n- Mordekaiser Face-Melter Damage over 3 seconds: 200/300/480 \u21d2 220/330/525\\n- Mordekaiser Face-Melter final Damage burst: 200/300/480 \u21d2 220/330/525\\n\\n---\\n### UNITS: TIER 4\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ Ahri\u2019s blowing kisses like they\u2019re going out of style, so we\u2019re asking her to chill a bit, and reducing her Attack Speed to slow down her cast rate.\\n\\nOur Karthus adjustments are to make him better at cleaning up fights with less remaining enemies, while being slightly less impactful at the start of a fight.\\n\\nTwisted Fate is already okay when he gets his narrow items and you\u2019re able to speed level to 8 with a strong frontline. By allowing bonus AS to create even more cards, we\u2019re opening up even more build paths. If you have a strong frontline and other sources of magic damage, opt for more AS to shred enemy MR and gradually take over fights. \\n- Ahri AS: 0.8 \u21d2 0.75\\n- Karthus starting Mana nerf: 40/120 \u21d2 30/120\\n- Karthus Mortal Reminder number of targets: 5 \u21d2 4/4/6\\n- Karthus Mortal Reminder Damage: 220/330/1000 \u21d2 270/405/900\\n- Twisted Fate Hustle & Shuffle AS needed per 1 bonus card: 40% \u21d2 20%\\n- Viego Riff of the Ruined King slam AD%: 200/200/400% \u21d2 225/225/450%\\n- Zac Mana buff: 60/130 \u21d2 60/120\\n- Zac Armor & MR: 60 \u21d2 70\\n- Zac Let\u2019s Bounce!

But even with that taken into account we\u2019d be remiss not to note his other weaknesses. More AD and a better AD ratio should make this Jazz Legendary worthy of three item slots.\\n\\nQiyana\u2019s power ceiling (printing items while also being a very strong unit) has been enabled by her strong damage ratios. We\u2019re lowering those, but also preserving her ability to copy multiple items at once to just her three-star form.\\n\\nOftentimes when we create a champion with multiple forms, one form becomes the dominant way to play, and we have to tinker with the other forms to keep them on par. This is that tinkering moment. Our goals with these changes are to have you select a Sona form based upon what your comp needs. Need more frontline\u2014choose Kinetic. Need to empower your AD allies\u2014choose Ethereal for Attack Speed. Need to do more damage, or amplify your other AP units\u2014choose Concussive. \\n- Lucian AD: 65 \u21d2 70\\n- Lucian Arpeggio Shot AD%: 55/55/1000% \u21d2 60/60/1000%\\n- Lucian Arpeggio spell now correctly scales with attack speed\\n- Qiyana Sample & Remix AD%: 500/500/1000 \u21d2 470/470/1000%\\n- Qiyana Sample & Remix Itemless additional True Damage: 75% \u21d2 60%\\n- Qiyana Sample & Remix number of Items Copied: 1/2/3 \u21d2 1/1/3\\n- Sona The Drop Kinetic (Heal Form) Heal per auto: 4/7/100% \u21d2 5/8/100%\\n- Sona The Drop Ethereal (Attack Speed Form) AS per Auto: 25/35/500% \u21d2 20/30/500%\\n- Sona The Drop Ethereal (Attack Speed Form) AS on Cast: 125/175/777% \u21d2 100/150/777%\\n- Sona The Drop Concussive (Damage Form) AP per auto: 2/3/100 \u21d2 3/4/100\\n- Ziggs AS: 0.8 \u21d2 0.85\\n- Ziggs Chaos Theory smaller bomb Damage: 70/105/400 \u21d2 90/135/500\\n\\n---\\n### HEADLINERS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ We\u2019re taking another pass on our underperforming Headliners, while shipping two nerfs to accommodate the buffs to their base forms for Garen and Yasuo.\\n\\nGnar\u2019s Headliner ability had him instantly transform, jump into the enemy team, and then get focused down. Delaying his jump should prevent this instant focus, allowing carry Gnar comps to lean more heavily into offense. \\n- Evelynn: 100 HP & 15 AP \u21d2 100 HP & 20 AP\\n- Olaf: 150 HP & 10 Armor/MR \u21d2 150 HP & 15 Armor/MR\\n- Tahm Kench: 225 HP \u21d2 300 HP\\n- Taric: 100 HP & 15 Armor \u21d2 150 HP & 15 Armor\\n- Vi: 150 HP & 20% AD \u21d2 250 HP & 15% AD\\n- Yasuo: 100 HP & 15% Omnivamp \u21d2 200 HP & 10% Omnivamp\\n- Aphelios: 20% AD \u21d2 25% AD\\n- Garen: 400 HP \u21d2 350 HP\\n- Gnar: Jump slightly delayed to after initial enemy targeting\\n- Gragas: 15% Damage & 10% DR \u21d2> 18% Damage & 10% DR\\n- Neeko: 200 HP & 20 Mana to Ally \u21d2 200 HP & 40 Mana to Ally\\n- Zac: 200 HP & 15 AP \u21d2 300 HP & 20 AP\\n- Kayn: 5 AP & Increased Rewards \u21d2 10 AP & Increased Rewards\\n\\n---\\n### AUGMENTS\\n\\n__Developer Notes:__ With our changes to streak gold, Consistency has been dramatically nerfed, so much so that we have opted to disable the Augment completely instead of finding a cheap way to buff it.\\n\\nWhile the stun duration on Crash Test Dummies has been lowered the delay on their initial jump will now result in stunned units targeting them (given that they are the dummies are the nearest enemies) once they come out of the stun.\\n\\nSubmit to the Pit (Mosher) is getting a rework that not only makes it more thematically relevant (Mosh with your pals), but also less awkward with constantly fluctuating stats. \\n- Cybernetic Bulk I/II/III HP: 222/333/555 \u21d2 200/300/500\\n- Best Friends I AS & Armor: 10 \u21d2 12\\n- Consistency has been Disabled\\n- Help is on the Way Turns to wait: 6 \u21d2 8\\n- Rolling for Days I Rerolls Granted: 8 \u21d2 9\\n- Rolling for Days I can now show up 3-2 and 4-2\\n- Stationary Support Turns to wait: 7 \u21d2 8\\n- Crash Test Dummies Stun Duration: 2 \u21d2 1.25 seconds\\n- Crash Test Dummies jump delayed to after initial enemy targeting\\n- Expose Weakness (Executioner) Shred & Sunder: 40% \u21d2 30%\\n- Extended Play (Punk) now grants 2 gold whenever a Punk champion is 2-starred.\\n- Heroic Grab Bag Gold: 2 \u21d2 4\\n- Little Buddies HP: 90 \u21d2 75\\n- Ramping Rhythm (Rapidfire) starting Stacks: 3 \u21d2 4\\n- Return on Investment Rerolls required: 18 \u21d2 16\\n- Submit To The Pit (Mosher) REWORKED: now grants the benefits based on nearby allies at the start of combat. 5 \u21d2 3 stats.\\n- Teaming Up II now can only show up on 4-2\\n- Three\u2019s a Crowd HP per 3-cost: 80 \u21d2 75\\n- Binary Airdrop now specifies that it will grant a recommended item.

Nearly all AP items have received a buff, while many other items are receiving new features to make them more flexible.\\n\\nBlue Buff and Red Buff have been the powerhouse core items that have enabled some of our most successful carries throughout patch 13.24. We\u2019re lowering their power here and letting the champions they\u2019ve enabled escape nerfs (Ahri being the exception with a small Attack Speed nerf).\\n\\nFinally, True Damage Emblem has significantly raised the power and desirability of Spatulas\u2014partially leading to the appeal of Open Forting for early priority on Carousel.
